# List of roguelike games to mod

The following games have open source code easily available on GitHub.

- Brogue CE (AGPL-3.0, C) - https://github.com/tmewett/BrogueCE/
- Sil-Q (Angband License, C) - https://github.com/sil-quirk/sil-q
- Angband (GPL-2.0/Angband License, C) - https://github.com/angband/angband
- Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup (GPL-2.0, C++) - https://github.com/crawl/crawl
- Nethack (Nethack General Public License, C) - https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack

In fact, all of these games are themselves variants ('forks', 'mods') of other games. For example, _Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup_ was forked from _Linley's Dungeon Crawl_. _Sil-Q_ was forked off of _Sil_, which itself was a heavily modified variant of _NPPAngband_, which was a variant of _Angband_. Brogue CE (Community Edition) is a fork of the original Brogue. My own variant [Brogue Lite][url-brogue-lite] is a lightly modified version of Brogue CE.

Forks range from minor modifications, to sweeping balance overhauls, to variant UI frontends, to games whose content and systems are so far removed from the original that they can be called "total conversions" or entire games of their own. For example, while _Sil_ is based on _Angband_, it changes the attributes and skill system, has a completely original combat algorithm, replaces the majority of creatures and items, and has a different game structure and goal.

The terms aren't strictly defined, but it generally seems that "mod" is used for minor changes, while "fork" is used for more games that have a more sustained period of development parallel to the original game. "Variant" is used similarly. (See also the Terminology section at the end of this document.)
