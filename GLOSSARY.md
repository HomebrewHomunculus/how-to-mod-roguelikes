- FOSS - free and open-source software.
- free software - free as in libre, not as in gratis (free of charge).
- open software - often used interchangeably with 'open-source'. In practice, all free software is open-source, but not all open-source software is free: if source code is provided, but you are not free to make a modified version and distribute it, then the software is not free. (The games covered here tend to be free and open-source. They are typically also copyleft: the modified versions that you create must also carry the same license. I am not a lawyer; always consult the license of the particular software you are modifying.)
- license - a software license, the contract that defines your rights to use, modify, and distribute the software. There are many standard types of licenses which grant different sets of rights. It is customary to place this in a LICENSE.md or LICENSE.txt file in the git repository. GitHub offers a nice utility for viewing standard licenses: click "View license" on the right sidebar of the project page.
